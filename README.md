# gterm - The Flyweight IDE in your Terminal

`gterm` is a powerful, stable and lightweight programmer's text editor in the terminal that provides tons of useful features without bogging down your workflow. It runs on Linux, Windows and MacOS. This is a terminal adaptation of [Geany](https://www.geany.org).

## Features

One of the primary reasons for gterm's existence is that there is a need for a decent, TUI (terminal user interface), lightweight, cross-platform, flexible and powerful IDE/editor that can be launched from a shell environment and still offer the point and click utility of a mouse and the standard file keyboard commands that most applications use.
